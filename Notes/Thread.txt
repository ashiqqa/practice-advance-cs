 //Advantage
    //Thread is a light weigh process that can make application more responsive user interface
    //To make efficient use of processor time while waiting for I/O operation to complete

    //Disadvantage
    //On a single processor/core machine threading can be effect performance negatively as there is overhead involved context switching
    //Multithread application are difficult to write, understand and debug and maintain
